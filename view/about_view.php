			<h2>What is Crowd Aid?</h2>
			<p>It is a web application with aim to address the disconnect between the people who needs health related help and those people who have the means to provide help by utilizing AI and crowdsourcing. The person who needs help can post what kind of help he needs to the Crowd Aid. The crowd can also post what kind of help they can provide. The AI will do the matching and if the matching failed, the crowdsourcing will connect the patient with the person who want to provide help.</p>
			<p>Example, when an outpatient needs an affordable oxygen tank or wheelchair, he can broadcast his need through Crowd Aid. The AI will try to match the need with what is posted. If matching is not successful, the crowdsourcing will take over to connect the patient and the person who want to provide help. </p>
			<p>This is not only limited to the medical equipments mentioned, it should also able to handle monetary help or information.</p> 
			<p>Eventually, we might add an option to allow them to sell medical related stuff at second-hand price.</p>
