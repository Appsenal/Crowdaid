# Crowdaid
 Do you have things that you do not need anymore but still useful? Oxygen tank, wheelchair and other medical items perhaps? Rather than throw it away, why not offer it to someone who needs it.
 
 CrowdAid is a concept propotype of a web application to connect the person who owns things that they do not need anymore but still useful to someone who needs it but don't have means to acquire it.
